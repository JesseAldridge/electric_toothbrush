Electric toothbrush now supports draw.io files. Instead of working with text files I'm going to be working with diagrams going forward.

1. Why diagrams?

Graphs are a better way to represent knowledge. You can refer to other ideas.

2. Can't words do that?

Yes they can, but you can't see the connections.

3. So graphs are better because you can see how ideas are connected?

Yeah

4. Why is it important to see how ideas are connected?

Because that allows you build a structure.

5. Ok, and structures are better for reasoning?

Yeah probably.

6. Ok, will their be UI difficulties? Sublime Text is a pretty smooth experience.

Create new note -> launch drawio -> double click -> start typing -> format text
yeah that might suck a bit, probably won't be too bad
I think the positives outweigh the negatives.

7. So you will still be searching the filename and content as before?

Yes

8. Will you port all of the old notes to drawio?

Yeah probably. Might retain backward compatibility.

9. Switching to diagrams might be easier?

Yeah, I should probably do that. Then I don't need match objects.

10. Ok, so what all needs to be done?

1/ When I open a new note, Drawio should launch rather than Sublime Text
2/ Same with creating new notes
3/ Maybe I should port the old text files to drawio diagrams

I think that's it.

11. Ok, how long will that take?

Probably the rest of today

12. Do you think there's a product here?

Maybe. I'm mostly building this for myself right now.

13. Are you going to make a replacement for Drawio?

Not right now. Maybe later. If this works really well.

14. Are you going to get rid of your old diagrams?

I'll probably incorporate them into the notes directory.

15. No more directory hierarchies then?

Nah, seems like filename tags work better.

16. Are you ditching multi tab diagrams?

Probably. We'll see.

17. In the electric toothbrush preview... what do you see?

You will see the text content of the diagram. No graph will be rendered.

18. Does electric toothbrush currently do tfidf?

I don't think so. I might add that. Actually maybe it does. It could I think.

19. Why do you think this idea is so important?

Manipulating information is the essense of my job. Anything that can help me do that better is great. This could potentially help me do that a lot better.

20. Aren't you always going to be bottlenecked by your brain?

Yeah, but having mental models accessible at my fingertips could be pretty huge.
